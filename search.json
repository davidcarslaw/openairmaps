Arguments passed openair::polarAnnulus resolution Two plot resolutions can set: “normal” “fine” (default). local.tz results calculated local time includes treatment daylight savings time (DST)? default consider DST issues, provided data imported without DST offset. Emissions activity tends occur local time e.g. rush hour 8 every day. clocks go forward spring, emissions effectively released atmosphere typically 1 hour earlier summertime .e. DST applies. plotting diurnal profiles, effect “smearing-” concentrations. Sometimes, useful approach express time local time. correction tends produce better-defined diurnal profiles concentration (variables) allows better comparison made emissions/activity data. set FALSE GMT used.

See cutData import details. type type determines data split .e. conditioned, plotted. default produce single plot using entire data. Type can one built-types detailed cutData e.g. “season”, “year”, “weekday” . example, type = \"season\" produce four plots --- one season. also possible choose type another variable data frame. variable numeric, data split four quantiles (possible) labelled accordingly. type existing character factor variable, categories/levels used directly. offers great flexibility understanding variation different variables depend one another. Type can length two e.g. type = c(\"season\", \"site\") produce 2x2 plot split season site. use two types mostly meant situations several sites. Note, two types provided first forms columns second rows. Also note polarAnnulus function type/period combinations forbidden make little sense. example, type =   \"season\" period = \"trend\" (result plot many gaps sensible smoothing), type = \"weekday\" period = \"weekday\". statistic statistic applied wind speed/direction bin. Can “mean” (default), “median”, “max” (maximum), “frequency”. “stdev” (standard deviation), “weighted.mean” “cpf” (Conditional Probability Function). smoothing involved, colour scale statistics provide indication overall pattern interpreted concentration units e.g. statistic =   \"weighted.mean\" bin mean multiplied bin frequency divided total frequency. many cases using polarFreq better. Setting statistic = \"weighted.mean\" can useful provides indication concentration * frequency occurrence highlight wind speed/direction conditions dominate overall mean. percentile statistic = \"percentile\" statistic =   \"cpf\" percentile used, expressed 0 100. Note percentile value calculated wind speed, wind direction ‘bins’. reason can also useful set min.bin ensure sufficient number points available estimate percentile. See quantile details percentiles calculated. width width annulus; can “normal” (default), “thin” “fat”. min.bin minimum number points allowed wind speed/wind direction bin.  default 1. value two requires least 2 valid records bin ; bins less 2 valid records set NA. Care taken using value > 1 risk removing real data points. recommended consider data care. Also, polarFreq function can use circumstances. exclude.missing Setting option TRUE (default) removes points plot far original data. smoothing routines produce predictions points data exist .e. predict. removing points far original data produces plot clear original data lie. set FALSE missing data interpolated. date.pad type = \"trend\" (default), date.pad = TRUE pad-missing data beginning first year end last year. purpose ensure trend plot begins ends beginning end year. force.positive default TRUE. Sometimes smoothing data steep gradients possible predicted values negative. force.positive = TRUE ensures predictions remain positive. useful several reasons. First, lots missing data interpolation needed can result artefacts predictions far original data. Second, known beforehand data positive, option carries assumption prediction. likely time setting force.positive = FALSE background concentrations first subtracted resulting data legitimately negative. vast majority situations expected user need alter default option. k smoothing value supplied gam temporal wind direction components, respectively. cases e.g. trend plot less 1-year data smoothing default values may become noisy affected outliers. Choosing lower value k (say 10) may help produce better plot. normalise TRUE concentrations normalised dividing mean value. done fitting smooth surface. option particularly useful one interested patterns concentrations several pollutants different scales e.g. NOx CO. Often useful one pollutant chosen. key.header Adds additional text/labels scale key. example, passing options key.header = \"header\", key.footer = \"footer1\" adds addition text scale key. arguments passed drawOpenKey via quickText, applying auto.text argument, handle formatting. key.footer see key.footer. key.position Location scale key plotted.
