**openairmaps** combines the robust analytical methods found in [**openair**](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair/) with a range of dynamic and static mapping capability. Core functionality includes visualising UK AQ networks (`networkMap()`), putting "polar directional markers" on maps (e.g., `polarMap()`) and overlaying HYSPLIT trajectories on maps (e.g., `trajMap()`), all using the `{leaflet}` package. Static equivalents of most functions are also available for insertion into traditional reports and academic articles.

## üí° Core Features

**openairmaps** has developed at pace to align **openair** with R's modern geospatial ecosystem.

- **Network visualisation** of many UK-based monitoring networks through `networkMap()`, all of which can also be searched using `searchNetwork()`.

- **Directional analysis maps** to place `openair::polarPlot()` and other "polar coordinate" plots on maps.

- **Trajectory analysis maps** (such as `trajMap()` and `trajLevelMap()`) for interactive implementations of the `openair::trajPlot()` family.

- **Flexible map conditioning** aligned with the **openair** `type` option to easily condition maps by season, day of the week, and so on.

- **Map building utilities** such as building popups for interactive maps, formatting common pollutant names and units, and converting UK postcodes to lat/lng coordinates.

## üìñ Documentation

All **openairmaps** functions are fully documented; access documentation using R in your IDE of choice.

```r
?openairmaps::polarMap
```

Documentation is also hosted online on the **package website**.
