    <dl><dt>lat, lng</dt>
<dd><p>The latitude and longitude for the location of interest.</p></dd>


<dt>source</dt>
<dd><p>One or more sources of meta data. Can be <code>aurn</code>, <code>saqn</code> (or
<code>saqd</code>), <code>aqe</code>, <code>waqn</code>, <code>ni</code>, <code>local</code> (or <code>lmam</code>), <code>kcl</code> or <code>europe</code>; upper
or lower case.</p></dd>


<dt>year</dt>
<dd><p>If a single year is selected, only sites that were open at some
point in that year are returned. If <code>all = TRUE</code> only sites that
measured a particular pollutant in that year are returned. Year can also be
a sequence e.g. <code>year = 2010:2020</code> or of length 2 e.g. <code>year =
  c(2010, 2020)</code>, which will return only sites that were open over the
duration. Note that <code>year</code> is ignored when the <code>source</code> is either
<code>"kcl"</code> or <code>"europe"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt>site_type</dt>
<dd><p>Optional. One or more site types with which to subset the
site metadata. For example, <code>site_type = "urban background"</code> will only
search urban background sites.</p></dd>


<dt>variable</dt>
<dd><p>Optional. One or more variables of interest with which to
subset the site metadata. For example, <code>variable = c("pm10", "co")</code> will
search sites that measure PM10 and/or CO.</p></dd>


<dt>max_dist</dt>
<dd><p>Optional. A maximum distance from the location of interest in
kilometres.</p></dd>


<dt>n</dt>
<dd><p>Optional. The maximum number of sites to return.</p></dd>


<dt>map</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>TRUE</code>, the default, <code>searchNetwork()</code> will return a <code>leaflet</code>
map. If <code>FALSE</code>, it will instead return a <a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble-package.html" class="external-link">tibble</a>.</p></dd>
