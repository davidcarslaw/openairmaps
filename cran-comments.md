# Submission

This is a minor release of `openairmaps`, with new features and bug fixes.

## Test environments

* local Windows 11 install, R 4.2.2
* win-builder (devel)
* r-hub

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

R-Hub returned with the following NOTE:

```
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
```

As noted in <https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503> this is likely a bug/crash in MiKTeX so can likely be ignored.
