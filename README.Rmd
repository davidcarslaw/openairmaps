<!-- badges: end -->

The main goal of `{openairmaps}` is to combine the robust analytical methods found in [`{openair}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair/) on a range of dynamic and static maps. Core functionality includes visualising UK AQ networks (`networkMap()`), putting "polar directional markers" on maps (e.g., `polarMap()`) and overlaying HYSPLIT trajectories on maps (e.g., `trajMap()`), all using the `{leaflet}` package. Static equivalents of most functions are also available for insertion into traditional reports and academic articles.

## Installation

You can install the release version of `{openairmaps}` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("openairmaps")
```

You can install the development version of `{openairmaps}` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("davidcarslaw/openairmaps")
```

## Documentation

All functions in `{openairmaps}` are thoroughly documented. The [openairmaps website](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openairmaps/) contains all documentation and a change log of new features. There are also many examples of `{openairmaps}` functionality the [openair book](https://bookdown.org/david_carslaw/openair/sections/maps/maps-overview.html), which goes into great detail about its various functions.

## The `{openair}` toolkit

-   [`{openair}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair/): Import, analyse, and visualise air quality and atmospheric composition data.

-   [`{worldmet}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/worldmet/): Access world meteorological data from NOAA's Integrated Surface Database.

-   [`{openairmaps}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openairmaps/): Visualise air quality data on interactive and static maps.

-   [`{deweather}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/deweather/): Use machine learning to remove the effects of meteorology on air quality time series.
