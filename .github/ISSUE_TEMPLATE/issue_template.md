Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a question, it may have already been answered in the [openair book](https://bookdown.org/david_carslaw/openair/). If not, we are more than happy to help!

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, a quick guide is provided [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>).
