\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame. The data frame must contain the data to plot the
directional analysis marker, which includes wind speed (\code{ws}), wind
direction (\code{wd}), and the column representing the concentration of a
pollutant. In addition, \code{data} must include a decimal latitude and
longitude.}

\item{pollutant}{The column name(s) of the pollutant(s) to plot. If multiple
pollutants are specified, they can be toggled between using a "layer
control" interface.}

\item{period}{This determines the temporal period to consider. Options are
"hour" (the default, to plot diurnal variations), "season" to plot
variation throughout the year, "weekday" to plot day of the week variation
and "trend" to plot the trend by wind direction.}

\item{limits}{By default, each individual polar marker has its own colour
scale. The \code{limits} argument will force all markers to use the same colour
scale. The limits are set in the form \code{c(lower, upper)}, so \code{limits = c(0, 100)} would force the plot limits to span 0-100.}

\item{latitude, longitude}{The decimal latitude/longitude. If not provided,
will be automatically inferred from data by looking for a column named
"lat"/"latitude" or "lon"/"lng"/"long"/"longitude" (case-insensitively).}

\item{control}{Column to be used for splitting the input data into different
groups which can be selected between using a "layer control" interface.
Appropriate columns could be those added by \code{\link[openair:cutData]{openair::cutData()}} or
\code{\link[openair:splitByDate]{openair::splitByDate()}}. \code{control} cannot be used if multiple \code{pollutant}
columns have been provided.}

\item{popup}{Column to be used as the HTML content for marker popups. Popups
may be useful to show information about the individual sites (e.g., site
names, codes, types, etc.).}

\item{label}{Column to be used as the HTML content for hover-over labels.
Labels are useful for the same reasons as popups, though are typically
shorter.}

\item{provider}{The base map(s) to be used. See
\url{http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/} for a list of
all base maps that can be used. If multiple base maps are provided, they
can be toggled between using a "layer control" interface.}

\item{cols}{The colours used for plotting. See \code{\link[openair:openColours]{openair::openColours()}} for
more information.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha transparency to use for the plotting surface (a value
between 0 and 1 with zero being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque).}

\item{key}{Should a key for each marker be drawn? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{draw.legend}{When \code{limits} are specified, should a shared legend be
created at the side of the map? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{collapse.control}{Should the "layer control" interface be collapsed?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{d.icon}{The diameter of the plot on the map in pixels. This will affect
the size of the individual polar markers. Alternatively, a vector in the
form \code{c(width, height)} can be provided if a non-circular marker is
desired.}

\item{d.fig}{The diameter of the plots to be produced using \code{openair} in
inches. This will affect the resolution of the markers on the map.
Alternatively, a vector in the form \code{c(width, height)} can be provided if a
non-circular marker is desired.}

\item{type}{Deprecated. Please use \code{label} and/or \code{popup} to label different
sites.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[openair:polarAnnulus]{openair::polarAnnulus}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{resolution}}{Two plot resolutions can be set: \dQuote{normal} and
\dQuote{fine} (the default).}
    \item{\code{local.tz}}{Should the results be calculated in local time that includes
a treatment of daylight savings time (DST)? The default is not to consider
DST issues, provided the data were imported without a DST offset. Emissions
activity tends to occur at local time e.g. rush hour is at 8 am every day.
When the clocks go forward in spring, the emissions are effectively
released into the atmosphere typically 1 hour earlier during the summertime
i.e. when DST applies. When plotting diurnal profiles, this has the effect
of \dQuote{smearing-out} the concentrations. Sometimes, a useful approach
is to express time as local time. This correction tends to produce
better-defined diurnal profiles of concentration (or other variables) and
allows a better comparison to be made with emissions/activity data. If set
to \code{FALSE} then GMT is used. Examples of usage include \code{local.tz
  = "Europe/London"}, \code{local.tz = "America/New_York"}. See
\code{cutData} and \code{import} for more details.}
    \item{\code{statistic}}{The statistic that should be applied to each wind
speed/direction bin. Can be \dQuote{mean} (default), \dQuote{median},
\dQuote{max} (maximum), \dQuote{frequency}. \dQuote{stdev} (standard
deviation), \dQuote{weighted.mean} or \dQuote{cpf} (Conditional Probability
Function). Because of the smoothing involved, the colour scale for some of
these statistics is only to provide an indication of overall pattern and
should not be interpreted in concentration units e.g. for \code{statistic =
  "weighted.mean"} where the bin mean is multiplied by the bin frequency and
divided by the total frequency. In many cases using \code{polarFreq} will
be better. Setting \code{statistic = "weighted.mean"} can be useful because
it provides an indication of the concentration * frequency of occurrence
and will highlight the wind speed/direction conditions that dominate the
overall mean.}
    \item{\code{percentile}}{If \code{statistic = "percentile"} or \code{statistic =
  "cpf"} then \code{percentile} is used, expressed from 0 to 100. Note that
the percentile value is calculated in the wind speed, wind direction
\sQuote{bins}. For this reason it can also be useful to set \code{min.bin}
to ensure there are a sufficient number of points available to estimate a
percentile. See \code{quantile} for more details of how percentiles are
calculated.}
    \item{\code{width}}{The width of the annulus; can be \dQuote{normal} (the default),
\dQuote{thin} or \dQuote{fat}.}
    \item{\code{min.bin}}{The minimum number of points allowed in a wind speed/wind
direction bin.  The default is 1. A value of two requires at least 2 valid
records in each bin an so on; bins with less than 2 valid records are set
to NA. Care should be taken when using a value > 1 because of the risk of
removing real data points. It is recommended to consider your data with
care. Also, the \code{polarFreq} function can be of use in such
circumstances.}
    \item{\code{exclude.missing}}{Setting this option to \code{TRUE} (the default)
removes points from the plot that are too far from the original data. The
smoothing routines will produce predictions at points where no data exist
i.e. they predict. By removing the points too far from the original data
produces a plot where it is clear where the original data lie. If set to
\code{FALSE} missing data will be interpolated.}
    \item{\code{date.pad}}{For \code{type = "trend"} (default), \code{date.pad = TRUE}
will pad-out missing data to the beginning of the first year and the end of
the last year. The purpose is to ensure that the trend plot begins and ends
at the beginning or end of year.}
    \item{\code{force.positive}}{The default is \code{TRUE}. Sometimes if smoothing data
with steep gradients it is possible for predicted values to be negative.
\code{force.positive = TRUE} ensures that predictions remain positive. This
is useful for several reasons. First, with lots of missing data more
interpolation is needed and this can result in artefacts because the
predictions are too far from the original data. Second, if it is known
beforehand that the data are all positive, then this option carries that
assumption through to the prediction. The only likely time where setting
\code{force.positive = FALSE} would be if background concentrations were
first subtracted resulting in data that is legitimately negative. For the
vast majority of situations it is expected that the user will not need to
alter the default option.}
    \item{\code{k}}{The smoothing value supplied to \code{gam} for the temporal and wind
direction components, respectively. In some cases e.g. a trend plot with
less than 1-year of data the smoothing with the default values may become
too noisy and affected more by outliers. Choosing a lower value of \code{k}
(say 10) may help produce a better plot.}
    \item{\code{normalise}}{If \code{TRUE} concentrations are normalised by dividing by
their mean value. This is done \emph{after} fitting the smooth surface.
This option is particularly useful if one is interested in the patterns of
concentrations for several pollutants on different scales e.g. NOx and CO.
Often useful if more than one \code{pollutant} is chosen.}
    \item{\code{key.header}}{Adds additional text/labels to the scale key. For example,
passing the options \code{key.header = "header", key.footer = "footer1"}
adds addition text above and below the scale key. These arguments are
passed to \code{drawOpenKey} via \code{quickText}, applying the
\code{auto.text} argument, to handle formatting.}
    \item{\code{key.footer}}{see \code{key.footer}.}
    \item{\code{key.position}}{Location where the scale key is to plotted. Allowed
arguments currently include \code{"top"}, \code{"right"}, \code{"bottom"}
and \code{"left"}.}
    \item{\code{auto.text}}{Either \code{TRUE} (default) or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}
titles and axis labels will automatically try and format pollutant names
and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the `2' in NO2.}

\code{\link[=annulusMap]{annulusMap()}} creates a \code{leaflet} map using polar annulus plots as markers.
Any number of pollutants can be specified using the \code{pollutant} argument, and
multiple layers of markers can be added and toggled between using \code{control}.
