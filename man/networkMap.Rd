\usage{
networkMap(
  source = "aurn",
  control = NULL,
  date = Sys.Date(),
  cluster = TRUE,
  provider = c("OpenStreetMap", "Esri.WorldImagery"),
  collapse.control = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{One or more data source for the meta data to be passed to
\code{\link[openair:importMeta]{openair::importMeta()}}. Can be any combination of \dQuote{aurn},
\dQuote{saqn} (or \dQuote{saqd}), \dQuote{aqe}, \dQuote{waqn}, \dQuote{ni},
\dQuote{local}, \dQuote{kcl} or \dQuote{europe}. See the "details" section
for further information about selecting multiple sites.}

\item{control}{Option to add a "layer control" menu to allow readers to
select between different site types. Can choose between effectively any
column in the \code{\link[openair:importMeta]{openair::importMeta()}} output, such as \dQuote{variable},
\dQuote{site_type}, or \dQuote{agglomeration}, as well as \dQuote{network}
when more than one \code{source} was specified.}

\item{date}{By default, \code{\link[=networkMap]{networkMap()}} visualises sites and pollutants which
are currently operational. Specifying \code{date} will visualise sites
which were operational at the chosen date. Dates should be provided in the
\dQuote{YYYY-MM-DD} format. Alternatively, a single year can be provided
(\dQuote{YYYY}) and \code{\link[=networkMap]{networkMap()}} will visualise sites which were
operational at the \emph{end} of that year (December 31st).}

\item{cluster}{When \code{cluster = TRUE}, markers are clustered together.
This may be useful for sources like \dQuote{kcl} where there are many
markers very close together. Defaults to \code{TRUE}, and is forced to be
\code{TRUE} when \code{source = "europe"} due to the large number of sites.}

\item{provider}{The base map(s) to be used. See
\url{http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/} for a list
of all base maps that can be used. If multiple base maps are provided, they
can be toggled between using a "layer control" interface.}

\item{collapse.control}{Should the "layer control" interface be collapsed?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A leaflet object.
}
\description{
This function uses \code{\link[openair:importMeta]{openair::importMeta()}} to obtain metadata for measurement
sites and uses it to create an attractive \code{leaflet} map. By default a
map will be created in which readers may toggle between a vector base map and
a satellite/aerial image, although users can further customise the control
menu using the \code{provider} and \code{control} parameters.
}
\details{
When selecting multiple data sources using \code{source}, please be mindful
that there can be overlap between the different networks. For example, an air
quality site in Scotland may be part of the AURN \emph{and} the SAQN.
\code{\link[=networkMap]{networkMap()}} will only show one marker for such sites, and uses the order
in which \code{source} arguments are provided as the hierarchy by which to
assign sites to networks. The aforementioned AURN & SAQN site will therefore
have its SAQN code displayed if \code{source = c("saqn", "aurn")}, and its
AURN code displayed if \code{source = c("aurn", "saqn")}.

This hierarchy is also reflected when \code{control = "network"} is used. As
\code{leaflet} markers cannot be part of multiple groups, the AURN & SAQN
site will be part of the "SAQN" layer control group when \code{source =
c("saqn", "aurn")} and the "AURN" layer control group when \code{source =
c("aurn", "saqn")}.

\dontrun{
# view one network, grouped by site type
networkMap(source = "aurn", control = "site_type")

# view multiple networks, grouped by network
networkMap(source = c("aurn", "waqn", "saqn"), control = "network")
}
