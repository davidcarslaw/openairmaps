\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame, the result of importing a trajectory file using
\code{\link[openair:importTraj]{openair::importTraj()}}.}

\item{latitude, longitude}{The decimal latitude/longitude.}

\item{pollutant}{Pollutant to be plotted. By default the trajectory height is
used.}

\item{control}{Used for splitting the trajectories into different groups
which can be selected between using a "layer control" menu. Passed to
\code{\link[openair:cutData]{openair::cutData()}}.}

\item{smooth}{Should the trajectory surface be smoothed? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Note that, when \code{smooth = TRUE}, no popup information will be available.}

\item{statistic}{Statistic to use for \code{\link[openair:trajLevel]{trajLevel()}}. By default, the function
will plot the trajectory frequencies (\code{statistic = "frequency"}). As an
alternative way of viewing trajectory frequencies, the argument \code{method = "hexbin"} can be used. In this case hexagonal binning of the trajectory
\emph{points} (i.e., a point every three hours along each back trajectory).
The plot then shows the trajectory frequencies uses hexagonal binning.

There are also various ways of plotting concentrations.

It is possible to set \code{statistic = "difference"}. In this case trajectories
where the associated concentration is greater than \code{percentile} are
compared with the the full set of trajectories to understand the
differences in frequencies of the origin of air masses. The comparison is
made by comparing the percentage change in gridded frequencies. For
example, such a plot could show that the top 10\\% of concentrations of PM10
tend to originate from air-mass origins to the east.

If \code{statistic = "pscf"} then a Potential Source Contribution Function map
is produced. This statistic method interacts with \code{percentile}.

If \code{statistic = "cwt"} then concentration weighted trajectories are
plotted.

If \code{statistic = "sqtba"} then Simplified Quantitative Transport Bias
Analysis is undertaken. This statistic method interacts with \code{.combine} and
\code{sigma}.}

\item{percentile}{The percentile concentration of \code{pollutant} against which
the all trajectories are compared.}

\item{lon.inc, lat.inc}{The longitude and latitude intervals to be used for
binning data.}

\item{min.bin}{The minimum number of unique points in a grid cell. Counts
below \code{min.bin} are set as missing.}

\item{.combine}{When statistic is "SQTBA" it is possible to combine lots of
receptor locations to derive a single map. \code{.combine} identifies the column
that differentiates different sites (commonly a column named \code{"site"}).
Note that individual site maps are normalised first by dividing by their
mean value.}

\item{sigma}{For the SQTBA approach \code{sigma} determines the amount of back
trajectory spread based on the Gaussian plume equation. Values in the
literature suggest 5.4 km after one hour. However, testing suggests lower
values reveal source regions more effectively while not introducing too
much noise.}

\item{cols}{Colours to be used for plotting. Options include "default",
"increment", "heat", "turbo" and \code{RColorBrewer} colours â€” see the
\code{\link[openair:openColours]{openair::openColours()}} function for more details. For user defined the
user can supply a list of colour names recognised by R (type
\code{\link[grDevices:colors]{grDevices::colours()}} to see the full list). An example would be \code{cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")}.}

\item{alpha}{Opacity of the tiles. Must be between \code{0} and \code{1}.}

\item{tile.border}{Colour to use for the border of binned tiles. Defaults to
\code{NA}, which draws no border.}

\item{provider}{The base map to be used. See
\url{http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/} for a list of
all base maps that can be used.}

\description{
This function plots back trajectories on a \code{leaflet} map. This function
requires that data are imported using the \code{\link[openair:importTraj]{openair::importTraj()}} function.
